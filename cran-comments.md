## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed a mispelled word in the description field of the DESCRIPTION file.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.
* There are no references describing the methods in this package.
* urlchecker::url_check() flags 'https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SSEparser' as error. It will stop failing once the package, hopefully, is accepted.
